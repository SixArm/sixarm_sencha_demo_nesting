Sencha demo to show how to create a model with nesting associations:

  * a User model with typical fields: id, name, and email.
  * an Item model that is nested inside the user.
  * a REST JSON request that can create and access users.

This demo is a simulation:

  * The request is simulated by reading a local file.
  * The file includes a simulated JSON response.

This demo is based on the Sencha tutorials and documentation.
